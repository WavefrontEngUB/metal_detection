INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

In this folder, there are 3 scripts that were used to develop the work, as well as several folders with images.

The folders: "stokes_metal", "stokes_plastic", "stokes_metal_boira", "stokes_plastic_boira", "stokes_metal_boira_2", "stokes_plastic_boira_2", 
correspond to the resulting images of the normalized Stokes parameters obtained from the 6 images taken by changing the analyzer, for each medium and object.

To obtain them, the Python script, "tots_stokes.py" has been used. In order to be able to run this script with the original images, contact llcaralr51@alumnes.ub.edu, 
so that he can provide you with the images, which are not attached in this folder because they take up many GBytes.

With the "calcul_transmi.py" script, the transmittance results presented in the work are obtained from the images found in the "calcul_transmi" folder.

Finally, with the "grafiques.py" script, all the graphics presented in the work are obtained, together. Those corresponding to the displacement of the mean points 
from 0 to 2 and from 1 to 2, where the lack of light for most of the samples does not exceed the validity condition, have not been presented in the work. 
The data found in the folders "mitjanes_0", "mitjanes_1", and "mitjanes_2" are used to display the graphs.
